# Refactoring a Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game

In this video miniseries I refactor a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game written in Python. In the first part I perform an analysis of the code and separate the user interface code from the game logic. In the second part, I refactor the game logic and improve the way that the rules of the game are defined
